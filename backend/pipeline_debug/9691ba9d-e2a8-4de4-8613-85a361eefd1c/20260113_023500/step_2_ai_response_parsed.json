Simultaneously, the Colombian labor market is navigating the effects of a significant 23% minimum wage increase, prompting internal adjustments and potential challenges for businesses [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. Meanwhile, global economic trends show a decrease in OECD inflation to 3.9% in November, primarily driven by food prices [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]].",

      "body": "The Colombian government has expressed strong reservations about the recent 10.9% increase in TransMilenio fares in Bogotá, arguing that the 23% rise in the minimum wage does not sufficiently justify the transportation fare hike [[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]][[REF:79edf6bf-c48f-4d93-8dff-cb641361151d]]. The Ministry of Transportation has requested a detailed technical analysis to support the decision [[REF:79edf6bf-c48f-4d93-8dff-cb641361151d]]. This comes as the broader Colombian labor market is experiencing significant shifts. A substantial 23% increase in the minimum wage at the start of 2026 is leading to internal adjustments and potentially challenging decisions for both companies and workers [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. Experts anticipate these adjustments will ripple throughout the entire salary structure [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]].",

This reduction is largely attributed to a decline in food prices, which fell to 4% in November, a full percentage point lower than in September [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. Conversely, energy prices experienced a slight increase, rising to 3.5% in November from 3.1% in September [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. Costa Rica remains the only OECD member with negative inflation, recorded at -0.4% in November, consistent with October levels [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. In contrast, coffee, tea, cocoa, sweets, and meat prices saw significant increases in 2025, contributing over 50% to the annual food inflation rate, with climate change identified as a major factor [[REF:a4d13076-a52d-4e41-8a01-46275a15dc5d]].",

This statement comes amidst discussions on border security and international cooperation, with Petro also convening the Advisory Commission on Foreign Relations to discuss matters concerning Venezuela and the United States [[REF:91f75218-2d5b-4b23-8397-ed4fb08b6a2f]][[REF:47372fbd-370a-4c07-9043-b62ff5e25bda]].

However, this proposal has faced criticism, with Sergio Fajardo labeling it an attempt to manipulate elections [[REF:ddb3d334-af5b-40e3-9c84-03943028b8cd]].
