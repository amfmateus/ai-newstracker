      "body": "The Colombian labor market is navigating significant changes at the start of 2026, primarily driven by a substantial 23% increase in the minimum wage [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. This rise is reconfiguring payroll expenses and initiating internal adjustments across businesses, posing difficult decisions for both companies and workers [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. In parallel, a new Labor Reform is set to alter the payment of severance interest starting in 2026. This reform aims to facilitate periodic income management and enhance financial planning for millions of Colombian workers and their employers [[REF:c0ca46c7-f938-4e34-9317-bff972c5d3fa]]. The reform allows for negotiated payment modalities, offering greater flexibility in financial strategies [[REF:c0ca46c7-f938-4e34-9317-bff972c5d3fa]].",

This development underscores the interconnectedness of global trade and the need for adaptive export strategies in response to geopolitical shifts [[REF:b099a7a8-0b1f-4bb7-96ed-4725bc442c8b]]. In separate foreign policy discussions, President Gustavo Petro convened the Advisory Commission on Foreign Relations to address key issues concerning border security and international cooperation, with specific discussions expected regarding Venezuela and the United States [[REF:91f75218-2d5b-4b23-8397-ed4fb08b6a2f]][[REF:47372fbd-370a-4c07-9043-b62ff5e25bda]]. Furthermore, Petro issued a warning to the ELN, indicating that joint military actions with Venezuela would occur if the group does not engage in the peace process and leave Venezuelan territory [[REF:ad721b43-7f12-47c6-afc5-9771ceafaa53]].",

The government contends that the proposed hike, raising the fare from $3,200 to $3,550 pesos, is not adequately justified by the minimum wage increase alone, despite the system's arguments that it is linked to a 23% rise in the minimum wage [[REF:79edf6bf-c48f-4d93-8dff-cb641361151d]][[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]].

While recent manufacturing data for September 2025 showed positive growth in production (5.2%) and sales (5.3%) compared to the previous year, a shift from negative rates, the overall sentiment remains cautious [[REF:9f058851-0697-49db-abde-a581e9bb6ecd]].

Inflationary trends are also a key concern. Globally, OECD inflation stood at 3.9% in November, driven down by food prices while energy prices saw an increase [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. Notably, coffee, tea, cocoa, sweets, and meat prices saw significant increases in 2025 due to climate change factors, contributing over 50% to the annual food inflation rate, according to the European Central Bank [[REF:a4d13076-a52d-4e41-8a01-46275a15dc5d]].",
