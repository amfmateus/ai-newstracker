      "body": "The government has expressed strong reservations regarding the recent 10.9% fare increase for TransMilenio in Bogota [[REF:79edf6bf-c48f-4d93-8dff-cb641361151d]]. The Ministry of Transportation has requested a technical explanation, arguing that the increase, set to raise the fare to $3,550, is not adequately justified by the minimum wage hike alone, despite the system's claims that it was based on the 23% increase in the minimum wage for 2026 [[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]]. This dispute highlights ongoing tensions between national and local authorities on economic policy implementation.\n\nConcurrently, the Colombian labor market is facing significant adjustments following a substantial 23% increase in the minimum wage for 2026 [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. Experts predict that this hike will trigger internal salary adjustments across various levels, potentially creating difficulties for businesses and impacting the formal employment sector. The base monthly income, including transportation assistance, now reaches $2 million, increasing labor costs for companies [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]].\n\nIn broader economic trends, inflation in OECD countries stood at 3.9% in November, with food prices contributing to a decrease while energy prices saw a slight increase [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. Notably, Costa Rica was the only OECD member with negative inflation [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. The European Central Bank reported that food prices, including coffee, tea, cocoa, sweets, and meat, surged in 2025 due to climate change, significantly impacting annual food inflation [[REF:a4d13076-a52d-4e41-8a01-46275a15dc5d]].",

This external policy decision necessitates strategic re-evaluation within regional trade dynamics.\n\nPresident Gustavo Petro has convened the Advisory Commission on Foreign Relations to discuss critical issues such as border security and international cooperation, with specific attention to relations with Venezuela and the United States [[REF:91f75218-2d5b-4b23-8397-ed4fb08b6a2f]][[REF:47372fbd-370a-4c07-9043-b62ff5e25bda]]. The commission aims to address key foreign policy matters and coordinate approaches to regional challenges.\n\nIn a significant development regarding internal security and international cooperation, President Petro issued a warning to the ELN guerrilla group. He stated that if the ELN does not join the peace process and withdraw from Venezuelan territory, Colombia will pursue joint military operations with Venezuela [[REF:ad721b43-7f12-47c6-afc5-9771ceafaa53]]. This ultimatum underscores the government's stance on armed groups operating across borders and its commitment to peace negotiation conditional on adherence to established protocols [[REF:a30943d0-d70d-4226-a3db-24f3a6b0957b]]. The ELN has responded by proposing a 'national agreement' amidst these potential joint actions [[REF:a30943d0-d70d-4226-a3db-24f3a6b0957b]].",

These exchanges highlight ongoing political debates over energy policy and its historical management.\n\nThe transfer of high-profile criminal leaders to Barranquilla has generated controversy, prompting the Minister of Justice to suspend the transfers amidst social pressure and conflicting statements [[REF:370895e7-1af9-42f4-844d-b52dac4bdf91]]. The Mayor of Cartagena proposed a regional summit to address the implications of such decisions [[REF:af42e6d9-a1e8-40a5-aedc-c62d233c1ab8]]. Petro himself responded to criticism regarding these transfers by noting a reduction in Barranquilla's homicide rate under his administration [[REF:2249a758-ae7c-4a77-9fb8-58ebd86a3534]].\n\nConcerns regarding political interference and potential corruption have surfaced. Allegations of political pressure on RTVC contractors, conditioning job continuity on political support, have been denounced through social media [[REF:a22acaff-7aa1-4a3d-a2fe-e9e544f10452]]. Additionally, a contract worth $10 billion for international defense has drawn criticism, with calls for an investigation from figures like Álvaro Uribe and Katherine Miranda [[REF:5cde12f8-1aee-4992-9ecd-4e5a5baf6c5c]]. Carlos Carrillo, director of UNGRD, accused Angie Rodriguez of nepotism in appointments to the Adaptation Fund, claiming friends and relatives were hired [[REF:2c3d6a6d-d70d-4226-a3db-24f3a6b0957b]].",
