  "summary": "The Colombian government has challenged the recent 10.9% fare increase for TransMilenio in Bogotá, questioning its justification beyond the minimum wage hike [[REF:79edf6bf-c48f-4d93-8dff-cb641361151d]][[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]]. Meanwhile, international trade dynamics are shifting, with potential tariffs impacting export strategies [[REF:b099a7a8-0b1f-4bb7-96ed-4725bc442c8b]].

      "body": "The government has expressed strong reservations regarding the recent 10.9% increase in TransMilenio fares in Bogotá. The Ministry of Transportation is requesting a technical analysis to justify the hike, arguing that it cannot be solely based on the minimum wage increase [[REF:79edf6bf-c48f-4d93-8dff-cb641361151d]]. The National Government echoes this sentiment, stating that the salary increase does not justify such a substantial jump in public transport fares [[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]]. \n\nIn parallel, the Colombian labor market is navigating significant shifts due to a substantial 23% minimum wage increase implemented at the start of 2026. This has triggered internal adjustments and raised concerns about wage compression and the sustainability of formal employment for businesses [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. Furthermore, upcoming changes with the Labor Reform in 2026 will alter how severance interest is paid to millions of workers, aiming to facilitate better financial planning for both employees and companies [[REF:c0ca46c7-f938-4e34-9317-bff972c5d3fa]]. New tax regulations will also impact pensioners, with some being exempt from income tax due to updated UVT calculations [[REF:f1cd3c56-20d2-4973-b71d-fd6638f88236]].",

The broader economic outlook for the country in 2026 is subject to uncertainty, influenced by upcoming elections, although there are hopes pinned on a potential change in government [[REF:9f058851-0697-49db-abde-a581e9bb6ecd]]. \n\nIn broader economic trends, inflation across OECD countries stood at 3.9% in November, with food prices contributing to a decrease, while energy prices saw a slight increase [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]]. Notably, specific food items like coffee, tea, cocoa, sweets, and meat experienced significant price surges in 2025, partly attributed to climate change and contributing substantially to food inflation rates, according to the European Central Bank [[REF:a4d13076-a52d-4e41-8a01-46275a15dc5d]].",

      "body": "President Gustavo Petro has engaged in discussions concerning national security and foreign relations. He convened the Advisory Commission on Foreign Relations to address critical points regarding border security and international cooperation, with specific focus on Venezuela and the United States [[REF:91f75218-2d5b-4b23-8397-ed4fb08b6a2f]][[REF:47372fbd-370a-4c07-9043-b62ff5e25bda]]. Petro issued a warning to the ELN, stating that joint military actions with Venezuela would occur if the group does not adhere to the peace process and withdraw from Venezuelan territory [[REF:ad721b43-7f12-47c6-afc5-9771ceafaa53]]. The ELN has, in turn, proposed a 'national agreement' amid these potential joint operations from the US and Colombia [[REF:a30943d0-d70d-4226-a3db-24f3a6b0957b]]. Petro also reacted to concerns regarding the transfer of criminal gang leaders to Barranquilla, highlighting his government's success in reducing the city's homicide rate [[REF:2249a758-ae7c-4a77-9fb8-58ebd86a3534]]. The Minister of Justice confirmed that the transfer of these leaders to Barranquilla is currently suspended due to ongoing controversies and social pressure [[REF:370895e7-1af9-42f4-844d-b52dac4bdf91]].\n\nPolitical discourse also involved accusations regarding energy rates, with President Petro criticizing former presidents Álvaro Uribe and Iván Duque [[REF:004a5bc9-a2c5-4460-b3d9-5fbaa59fa6d1]]. Criticism continues over a significant $10 billion contract for international defense, prompting calls for investigation from Álvaro Uribe and Katherine Miranda [[REF:5cde12f8-1aee-4992-9ecd-4e5a5baf6c5c]]. Furthermore, allegations of political pressure on RTVC contractors to secure their employment through political support have been denounced [[REF:a22acaff-7aa1-4a3d-a2fe-e9e544f10452]]. Carlos Carrillo, director of UNGRD, accused Angie Rodriguez of nepotism within the Adaptation Fund [[REF:2c3d6a6d-d7d3-46f5-ae01-b2bcee87f23e]].",
