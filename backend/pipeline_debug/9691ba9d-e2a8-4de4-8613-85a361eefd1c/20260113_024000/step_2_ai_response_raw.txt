The Ministry of Transportation has requested a thorough technical analysis to support the decision [[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]]. In the labor sector, significant changes are expected in 2026 due to the Labor Reform, which will alter the payment of severance interest for millions of Colombian workers, aiming to facilitate financial planning for both employees and companies [[REF:c0ca46c7-f938-4e34-9317-bff972c5d3fa]]. The broader labor market is experiencing wage compression and internal adjustments stemming from a substantial 23% minimum wage increase at the start of 2026, which has reconfigured payroll costs and presents difficult decisions for businesses [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]]. Additionally, new regulations from the Dian will impact how pensions are taxed in 2026, potentially exempting certain pensioners from income tax [[REF:f1cd3c56-20d2-4973-b71d-fd6638f88236]].",

In Europe, the European Central Bank noted that the surge in food commodity prices in 2025, including coffee, tea, cocoa, sweets, and meat, was significantly influenced by climate change, contributing over 50% to the annual food inflation rate [[REF:a4d13076-a52d-4e41-8a01-46275a15dc5d]].

This stance comes as the ELN itself proposes a 'national agreement', a move met with skepticism by figures like Sergio Fajardo, who suggests it aims to manipulate upcoming elections [[REF:ddb3d334-af5b-40e3-9c84-03943028b8caa30943d0-d70d-4226-a3db-24f3a6b0957b]].
