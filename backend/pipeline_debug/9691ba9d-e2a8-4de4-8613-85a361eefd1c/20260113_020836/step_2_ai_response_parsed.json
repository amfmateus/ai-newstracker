Concurrently, the government is questioning a proposed fare increase for TransMilenio in Bogotá, arguing it lacks justification despite the system's claims related to minimum wage adjustments [[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]]. These economic shifts occur amidst broader economic discussions on inflation trends within OECD countries [[REF:5b6421ce-5129-49fb-a4ff-6d60407f595e]] and the rising prices of essential food items like coffee and meat due to climate change [[REF:a4d13076-a52d-4e41-8a01-46275a15dc5d]].",

This rise has reconfigured payroll costs and initiated internal adjustments across the salary structure, creating a 'domino effect' on employment sustainability [[REF:2a637c03-7833-42dd-98a4-a312ebaa8211]].

While TransMilenio cited a 10.9% increase due to the minimum wage hike, the government argues that the minimum wage adjustment does not warrant such a fare hike [[REF:624d95c5-12c4-4917-a36b-c79ccf14d9b8]].
