This acceleration was largely fueled by a substantial increase in industrial sector output, which benefited from favorable trade conditions and improved access to international markets for manufactured goods [[REF:reuters_2026_01_12_trade_boost_industrial_output_11223]]. The positive momentum suggests a strengthening business climate and increased demand for domestically produced goods, both domestically and abroad [[REF:bloomberg_2026_01_12_colombia_gdp_surge_94512]].
