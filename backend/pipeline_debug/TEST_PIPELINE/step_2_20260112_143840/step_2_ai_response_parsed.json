This policy shift, which proposes setting VIS prices in Colombian pesos and caps the maximum value, has ignited debate regarding its potential to influence housing supply, prices, and overall market viability [[REF:b3fadacf-c514-4773-b34b-edbbdf66f72c]][[REF:89c612ef-1e77-40c0-8174-9303c3402245]]. While proponents argue it prevents abuses against vulnerable populations and enhances transparency [[REF:ca5da616-ecf4-4f90-b4cf-8ad23b7cfd0a]], critics suggest it might lead to reduced supply and higher costs, particularly for lower-income families [[REF:8be28d58-f18d-4b68-bd67-8b0cd601a4e6]][[REF:c569526c-d5df-4dfe-afb7-03bd5d869f11]].

      "body": "The recent 23% increase in the minimum wage for 2026 is projected to have widespread economic repercussions across various sectors. Restaurants, in particular, are anticipating significant cost pressures, leading to potential closures, menu adjustments, and layoffs due to increased payroll expenses [[REF:677d8039-b38f-4caa-bf17-eea4e821795d]][[REF:e0e09746-23f8-4184-b6f4-85e4d9753d98]]. Similarly, property management companies in residential complexes are warning of potential increases in administration fees as contracts are often indexed to the minimum wage [[REF:41ad1eb0-e4b6-41dc-8799-0fc4d2a38cb3]]. This has prompted government warnings to condo owners about how these fee adjustments should be managed, emphasizing inflation as a primary factor for increases [[REF:97a7688e-94a8-416f-bb86-66f53ab8fde3]]. The debate extends to whether companies should raise salaries for employees earning above the minimum wage, considering labor laws and economic realities [[REF:36c7a3bc-e8c5-458e-99a2-0a64cf063efe]].",

This contrasts with the OECD's general inflation rate, which stood at 3.9% in November, largely influenced by decreased food prices [[Ref:019ef0ce-01c2-4585-92e0-7e3353c4049b]]. The price of food and energy experienced varied changes, with food prices declining while energy prices saw a slight increase [[Ref:019ef0ce-01c2-4585-92e0-7e3353c4049b]]. In a separate report, coffee, tea, cocoa, sweets, and meat were identified as food items with the most significant price increases in 2025, contributing substantially to food inflation due to climate change and rising commodity prices [[Ref:37f6510d-86d3-4f66-914e-e1cce4fb2a9d]]. The Colombian peso has shown volatility in early 2026, influenced by external factors and US inflation data [[Ref:5d6bfb0b-29af-47de-b014-cd946d437863]].
