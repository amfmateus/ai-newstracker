      "body": "The Colombian government is actively implementing measures to stabilize housing costs amidst economic shifts, particularly concerning the minimum wage increase.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing has published a draft decree aimed at de-indexing Social Interest Housing (VIS) from the minimum wage, a move designed to protect buyers from potential price hikes stemming from the recent 23% increase in the minimum wage [[REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]][[REF:4cd41845-7a5d-4f49-896e-db2b9127cdf4]][[REF:77f5c0be-4186-4a16-9e6e-cf94e6d244f9]]. This initiative seeks to establish clear pricing rules in Colombian pesos and prevent automatic increases tied to the minimum wage, thereby safeguarding consumer interests [[REF:89c612ef-1c90-4326-aa81-547e5925e3b8]][[REF:93a38ab5-31f6-44b5-b4ea-e2f2e2d763e5]].\n\nPresident Gustavo Petro has also directly addressed concerns regarding administration fees in residential complexes, urging property owner assemblies to base any increases on inflation rather than the minimum wage and to avoid \"unjustified\" hikes [[REF:12cd82d2-4ec1-49da-9c0f-6102d05ac521]][[REF:33dedb3f-e289-47a4-ae06-ee114e033836]][[REF:81e8a5fb-e153-4a16-9e6e-cf94e6d244f9]][[REF:97a7688e-94a8-416f-bb86-66f53ab8fde3]]. These calls aim to foster responsible financial management within condominium associations.\n\nThe broader economic landscape shows that the increase in minimum wage and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are creating significant cost pressures for the restaurant industry, potentially leading to closures, menu adjustments, and layoffs [[REF:677d8039-b38f-4caa-bf17-eea4e821795d]]. Similarly, essential services like private security and cleaning in residential buildings often have contracts tied to the minimum wage, suggesting that fee increases might be unavoidable for some complexes [[REF:41ad1eb0-e4b6-41dc-8799-0fc4d2a38cb3]].\n\nIn terms of financial markets, experts surveyed by Fedesarrollo predict interest rates to conclude 2026 at 9.25% and to be at 9.50% in the first quarter, indicating an impact on Colombia's economic indicators [[REF:1b637b3c-d466-48a2-962a-41a80a660f9f]].

International observation missions are expected to monitor these elections [[REF:4d5ddbc3-c9fd-409f-81e0-209b38d64941]].\n\nIn terms of justice, the Supreme Court has expanded protections for pre-pensioners by issuing new guidelines to prevent their dismissal [[REF:03f10ce7-e799-4b91-a4d5-864ae5ca4976]].",
