The government is attempting to mitigate some of these effects by proposing regulations to decouple housing prices from minimum wage indexing and ensure consumer protection [[REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]][[REF:77f5c0fe-4186-4e9f-b785-dcf675841a6a]][[REF:4cd41845-7a5d-4f49-896e-db2b9127cdf4]].

      "body": "The Colombian economy is facing significant adjustments due to a substantial 23% increase in the minimum wage for 2026 [[REF:51560711-334c-410f-a8ee-760d0d16291f]]. This rise is projected to have a ripple effect across various sectors, with restaurants, in particular, warning of potential closures, menu changes, and layoffs due to increased payroll costs [[REF:677d8039-b38f-4caa-bf17-eea4e821795d]]. The popular 'corrientazo' lunch may also see price hikes as businesses grapple with higher operational expenses [[REF:e0e09746-23f8-4184-b6f4-85e4d9753d98]]. The government, recognizing these challenges, is taking steps to mitigate the impact. A draft decree aims to prevent Social Interest Housing (VIS) prices from being indexed to the minimum wage, requiring instead that they be set in Colombian pesos [[REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]][[REF:4cd41845-7a5d-4f49-896e-db2b9127cdf4]][[REF:89c612ef-1c90-4326-aa81-547e5925e3b8]]. This move seeks to protect homebuyers from automatic price increases tied to the minimum wage [[REF:77f5c0fe-4186-4e9f-b785-dcf675841a6a]]. President Petro has also urged property owner assemblies to base administration fee increases on inflation rather than arbitrary hikes [[REF:97a7688e-94a8-416f-bb86-66f53ab8fde3]]. Despite these measures, expert forecasts suggest continued economic pressures, with inflation and interest rates remaining critical factors influencing the economic landscape throughout 2026 [[REF:1b637b3c-dc79-426e-8112-cd22b041bfee]][[REF:475caf6f-7738-446a-9650-5c516a0651fd]].",

This strong performance has secured funding and enabled the advancement of various infrastructure projects across Bogotá, including roadworks and public space improvements, with further interventions planned for 2026 [[REF:5620bbaa-cc8f-4840-ac11-ddd30b23fc9f]]. The Mayor of Bogotá, Carlos Fernando Galán, announced the completion of the concrete structure for a critical vehicular bridge on First of May Avenue, a significant step for the city's mobility and a key component for Line 1 of the Bogotá Metro [[REF:e6a81692-cdce-44c9-b160-ab004e6bba05]][[REF:ef330444-d285-4a06-b4ab-67310d83c289]].

In terms of foreign investment, the Mexican fintech unicorn Stori has received authorization from Colombia's Financial Superintendence to establish operations, marking a notable expansion into the Colombian financial services sector [[REF:8b1ec07c-3604-4a33-805e-eb32e51e8512]].
