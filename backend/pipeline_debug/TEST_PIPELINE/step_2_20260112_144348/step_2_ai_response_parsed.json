  "summary": "Colombia's economy faces a complex interplay of rising costs and policy adjustments, primarily driven by a significant 23% increase in the minimum wage for 2026.\nThis hike is expected to impact various sectors, from restaurants facing potential closures and layoffs [[REF:677d8039-b38f-4caa-bf17-eea4e821795d]] to residential complex administration fees [[REF:41ad1eb0-e4b6-41dc-8799-0fc4d2a38cb3]]. The government is attempting to mitigate some of these effects by proposing regulations to prevent Social Interest Housing (VIS) prices from being indexed to the minimum wage [[REF:77f5c0be-4186-4ecf-8079-d9dedc7d14e7]], instead requiring prices to be set in Colombian pesos [[REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]]. Experts predict a challenging economic landscape for 2026, marked by inflation and interest rate pressures [[REF:475caf6f-7738-446a-9650-5c516a0651fd]].",

      "body": "The Colombian economy is navigating significant shifts following the government's decision to implement a 23% increase in the minimum wage for 2026 [[REF:51560711-334c-410f-a8ee-760d0d16291f]]. This substantial adjustment is projected to have wide-ranging effects across various economic sectors.\n\nIn the residential sector, the government has proposed new regulations aimed at protecting homebuyers by preventing Social Interest Housing (VIS) prices from being indexed to the minimum wage [[REF:77f5c0be-4186-4ecf-8079-d9dedc7d14e7]]. Instead, the Ministry of Housing has published a draft decree mandating that VIS properties be priced in Colombian pesos, thereby disassociating them from automatic adjustments tied to the minimum wage [[REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]]. This move seeks to ensure affordability and prevent future price increases not linked to actual construction costs [[REF:89c612ef-1c90-4326-aa81-547e5925e3b8]].\n\nThe impact of the minimum wage hike is also being felt in the restaurant industry, where businesses are warning of potential closures, menu changes, and layoffs. The increased payroll costs, which can represent up to 25% of operating expenses for formal establishments, are forcing immediate adjustments [[REF:677d8039-b38f-4caa-bf17-eea4e821795d]]. Similarly, administration fees in residential complexes are subject to potential increases, prompting President Gustavo Petro to urge property owners to manage costs prudently and base adjustments on inflation rather than simply the minimum wage [[REF:97a7688e-94a8-416f-bb86-66f53ab8fde3]].\n\nEconomic experts surveyed by Fedesarrollo anticipate a challenging economic environment for 2026, with projections indicating continued pressure from inflation and interest rates [[REF:1b637b3c-dc79-426e-8112-cd22b041bfee]]. The real increase in the minimum wage, after accounting for inflation, is estimated at 17.9% [[REF:51560711-334c-410f-a8ee-760d0d16291f]], a figure that contributes to the broader economic concerns.",
