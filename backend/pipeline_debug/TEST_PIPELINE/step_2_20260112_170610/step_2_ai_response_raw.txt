Experts surveyed by Fedesarrollo anticipate interest rates to conclude the year at 9.25%, with a slightly higher 9.50% expected in the first quarter [[REF:1b637b3c-dc79-426e-8112-cd22b041bfee]].

The Ministry of Housing has published a draft decree aimed at preventing Social Interest Housing (VIS) prices from being indexed to the minimum wage, requiring prices to be fixed in Colombian pesos [[REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]][[REF:4cd41845-7a5d-4f49-896e-db2b9127cdf4]]. This initiative seeks to protect buyers and avoid automatic price increases not tied to actual construction costs [[REF:89c612ef-1e90-4326-aa81-547e5925e3b8]]. Furthermore, President Gustavo Petro has urged property owner assemblies to manage administration fees prudently, basing increases on inflation rather than solely the minimum wage [[REF:12cd82d2-4ec1-49da-9c0f-6102d05ac521]][[REF:33dedb3f-e289-47a4-ae06-ee114e033836]][[REF:97a7688e-94a8-416f-bb86-66f53ab8fde3]].
