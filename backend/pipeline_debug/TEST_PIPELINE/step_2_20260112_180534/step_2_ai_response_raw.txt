This adjustment is directly impacting household expenses, including administration fees for residential complexes, where increases are being advised to align with inflation rather than solely the minimum wage [[REF:12cd82d2-4ec1-49da-9c0f-6102d05ac521]][[REF:41ad1eb0-e4b6-41dc-8799-0fc4d2a38cb3]][[REF:81e8a5fb-e153-4a16-9e6e-cf94e6d244f9]].

The popular \"corrientazo\" lunch is also expected to see price increases [[REF:e0e09746-23f8-4184-b6f4-85e4d9753d98]]. Furthermore, experts anticipate that the effects of inflation and the minimum wage adjustment will impact fines, such as traffic fines, making them more costly [[REF:c84e6c4b-737b-4aa2-af8f-e6e42a50bfb2]]. The government has acknowledged the need to manage these economic shifts, with President Petro urging property owners to control costs and avoid excessive increases in administration fees [[REF:97a7688e-94a8-416f-bb86-66f53ab8fde3]].",
