      "body": "The recent 23% increase in Colombia's minimum wage is creating significant ripple effects across the labor market and the broader economy [[REF:0b7f9f47-320c-4295-8469-6e13a722f1ae]]. This adjustment is reportedly leading to wage compression and internal adjustments for businesses, altering payroll costs and forcing difficult decisions for both companies and employees [[REF:0b7f9f47-320c-4295-8469-6e13a722f1ae]]. In response to observed price increases, President Gustavo Petro has announced that the government, in conjunction with the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce (SIC), will investigate companies suspected of irrationally raising prices to protect consumer rights and ensure fair market conditions [[REF:0016357a-1808-4053-84bb-159427b6d012], [REF:6f18be2d-f143-4f7c-8caf-9feb53052269]]. Experts and political figures have also warned about the potential inflationary consequences of the wage hike, with some highlighting that even daily meals (\"corrientazos\") may see price increases of up to 23% [[REF:6ee5696f-4a85-480e-baa5-69fc706d22cf]]. The impact extends to government finances, with concerns raised about the increased costs for pensions, health services, and subsidies [[REF:9c67f87e-326a-47c5-81de-a013108c8c89]].",

          "body": "New government decrees concerning Social Interest Housing (VIS) are generating considerable debate. One decree proposes to de-link housing prices from the minimum wage, establishing a maximum value for VIS properties equivalent to 135 minimum monthly legal wages [[REF:b3fadacf-c514-4773-b34b-edbbdf66f72c]]. While intended to increase transparency, critics like former Minister of Finance José Manuel Restrepo and Representative Carolina Arbeláez warn that this could lead to reduced supply, higher prices, and diminished legal certainty, disproportionately affecting lower-income families [[REF:345a3d34-2d49-43b8-9a7c-f39be61df9d8], [REF:8be28d58-f18d-4b68-bd67-8b0cd601a4e6], [REF:c569526c-d5df-4dfe-afb7-03bd5d869f11]]. President Petro, however, has denied that the VIS regulations are a direct consequence of the minimum wage increase, labeling such a connection an \"economic aberration\" and emphasizing the unfairness of citizens relying on the \"vital salary\" for housing costs [[REF:aa66e08c-b7b9-4b5e-8441-323d9b5962c1]]. Minister of Labor Antonio Sanguino has publicly supported the new policy, advocating for pricing in Colombian pesos and increased transparency to prevent abuses against the poor [[REF:ca5da616-ecf4-4f90-b4cf-8ad23b7cfd0a]].",

The ELN has proposed a \"national agreement\" focused on combating poverty and corruption, which political leaders like Sergio Fajardo have rejected as an attempt to manipulate elections [[REF:1da207ca-a952-408f-8f66-0a3d3bd05f75], [REF:5c8b1bb7-5008-4e11-b54f-5ebae58553dd], [REF:c089608d-d93b-493d-ac57-5b57b14b503b]].
