Meanwhile, the government's proposed housing policy, which aims to de-link Social Interest Housing prices from minimum wage increases and cap prices at 135 minimum monthly legal wages, has sparked significant debate regarding its economic and financial impacts [[REF:b3fadacf-c514-4773-b34b-edbbdf66f72c], [REF:c569526c-d5df-4dfe-afb7-03bd5d869f11]].

      "body": "Colombia's annual inflation rate concluded 2025 at 5.10%, showing minimal change from the previous year, with monthly inflation in December recorded at 0.27% [[REF:eff8f5dc-16c2-4401-ba5e-17ecfc21d163]]. This stability in general inflation contrasts with specific sector discussions, particularly concerning housing policy. The government has introduced a draft decree that seeks to de-link the pricing of Social Interest Housing (VIS) from minimum wage increases, aiming instead to set a maximum price in Colombian pesos [[REF:b3fadacf-c514-4773-b34b-edbbdf66f72c], [REF:4cd41845-7a5d-4f49-896e-db2b9127cdf4]]. This proposed regulation would cap VIS prices at the equivalent of 135 minimum monthly legal wages, or approximately $236.3 million Colombian pesos, and aims to prevent automatic price adjustments tied to minimum wage hikes, thereby protecting buyers [[REF:89c612ef-1c90-4326-aa81-547e5925e3b8], [REF:0efea05a-a950-4a24-a476-69786837741a]]. The initiative has generated significant debate within the construction and political sectors regarding its potential impact on housing supply and financial viability [[REF:c569526c-d5df-4dfe-afb7-03bd5d869f11], [REF:5623f2f7-b6e7-4ba8-95cd-f59c375a6ce6]].",

These developments occurred against a backdrop of geopolitical instability and expectations of potential interest rate cuts in the United States [[REF:0ead46f4-dd82-4b14-a9a5-9510d2948110]]. In parallel, diplomatic exchanges between Colombia and the United States have improved, potentially paving the way for the elimination of tariffs on key products such as steel and aluminum [[REF:7debef88-93e8-4ef1-80d7-fd488831d5b6]].",
