Similarly, food prices are expected to rise, impacting both basic meals and high-end restaurants [[REF:de189a65-3cd5-4983-a591-b7379457ee0a]]. The government, led by President Petro, has vowed to investigate companies that irrationally increase prices following the wage adjustment, aiming to protect consumer rights and ensure fair market conditions [[REF:0016357a-1808-4053-84bb-159427b6d012]][[REF:f38c293d-6b88-4ae1-ae6a-990d3aaf7752]][[REF:6f18be2d-f143-4f7c-8caf-9feb53052269]].",
