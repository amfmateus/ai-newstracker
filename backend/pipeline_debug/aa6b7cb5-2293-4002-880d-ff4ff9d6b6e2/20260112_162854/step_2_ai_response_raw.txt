Experts indicate this will lead to internal adjustments and could pose difficult decisions for companies [[REF:0b7f9f47-320c-4295-8469-6e13a722f1ae]]. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly advised to make careful financial decisions to navigate the uncertainty and increased costs associated with the new wage scale [[REF:4176025e-0ec2-4e52-ab85-f18db6c19506]]. The rise in the minimum wage is also expected to contribute to increased prices for everyday meals, commonly known as 'corrientazos' [[REF:ee0e09746-23f8-4184-b6f4-85e4d9753d98]]. Chef Leonor Espinosa forecasts that this economic pressure will lead to higher input and food prices, affecting both casual eateries and high-end restaurants [[REF:de189a65-3cd5-4983-a591-b7379457ee0a]]. The minimum wage hike is also linked to potential changes in housing price regulations, with the government proposing to de-link them, a move that has sparked debate about its economic and financial consequences, especially for lower-income households [[REF:b3fadacf-c514-4773-b34b-edbbdf66f72c], [REF:c569526c-d5df-4dfe-afb7-03bd5d869f11]].",
