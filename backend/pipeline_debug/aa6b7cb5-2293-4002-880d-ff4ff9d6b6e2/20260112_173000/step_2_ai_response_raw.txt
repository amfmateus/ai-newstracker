On the political front, debates persist around the ELN's \"national agreement\" proposal and the government's handling of security matters, particularly concerning the transfer of criminal leaders to Barranquilla [[REF:ad62d74d-c08c-4d74-b42c-195cb08592f5]].

      "body": "Colombia's economic landscape in early 2026 is marked by persistent inflation and the ripple effects of a significant minimum wage increase. Annual inflation concluded 2025 at 5.10%, a figure that remained virtually unchanged from the prior year, with monthly inflation for December recorded at 0.27% [[REF:eff8f5dc-16c2-4401-ba5e-17ecfc21d163]]. The 23% increase in the minimum wage is expected to create further government expenses, impacting pensions, health services, and subsidies, while also complicating financial sustainability and potentially fueling inflation [[REF:9c67f87e-326a-47c5-81de-a013108c8c89]]. This wage adjustment is also causing wage compression and internal adjustments within the labor market, forcing difficult decisions for businesses [[REF:0b7f9f47-320c-4295-8469-6e13a722f1ae]]. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face particular challenges, needing to make astute financial decisions in a high-cost environment and amid economic uncertainty [[REF:4176025e-0ec2-4e52-ab85-f18db6c19506]].\n\nExperts are sounding alarms over the government's intensive use of tax withholdings as a revenue-gathering tool, which is severely impacting company cash flow and straining the DIAN's refund system [[REF:b9b79e4f-72c9-45e6-b966-08c254df914e]]. The Colombian peso has experienced considerable volatility in early 2026, influenced by external and internal factors such as US PCE inflation data [[REF:5d6bfb0b-29af-47de-b014-cd946d437863]]. However, rising oil prices and attractive investor rates could potentially favor the Colombian peso in mid-January [[REF:67293c83-df6b-4168-af7f-a0aaa7754447]]. In a broader regional context, Costa Rica leads Latin America in minimum wage, with Colombia's position also noted [[REF:0bd0b48a-c965-4c42-bf0b-ff40732cbe56]].",

      "body": "The political sphere remains active with ongoing debates and governmental actions. President Gustavo Petro has been active on multiple fronts, responding to the ELN's proposal for a \"national agreement\" and recalling previous failed peace processes [[REF:10e6d1b4-5fa2-4741-aaa0-8a5f28f4bbc4]]. The ELN's proposal for a \"national agreement\" to overcome the conflict, focused on institutionalizing measures against poverty and corruption, has drawn varied reactions, with some political leaders rejecting it as an attempt to manipulate elections [[REF:5c8b1bb7-5008-4e11-b54f-5ebae58553dd], [REF:c089608d-d93b-493d-ac57-5b57b14b503b], [REF:1da207ca-a952-408f-8f66-0a3d3bd05f75]].\n\nConcerns regarding security and governance are prominent, particularly the government's decision to transfer criminal leaders, such as alias 'Negro Ober', to Barranquilla.

He also stated that the core issue impacting the housing sector is the interest rate [[REF:5623f2f7-b6e7-422d-b59e-ebd61d71d87c]]. Political figures like Ingrid Betancourt have criticized President Petro's perceived silence on the repression of women in Iran, contrasting it with his engagement on other international conflicts [[REF:85e68dff-842a-4bf6-95ad-34298d798c3a]].",
